    'body' => 'A project on the establishment of the country\'s first plant for conveyor belts, agricultural and automobile tires is currently in progress on the territory of the Angren SIZ.
<br><br>
Today, the republic is in dire need of domestic production of rubber products. In the country, which annually produces more than 200,000 cars, where millions of cars run on the roads, not to mention the agricultural sector with its tractors and industries operated by conveyor belts, it is the issue of economic sovereignty.
<br><br>
According to experts, imports of rubber products in Uzbekistan cost more than $160 million annually, tending to grow with each passing year. A new plant, which is scheduled for commissioning in the third quarter of 2018, is called to change the tendency. In the first phase, it will produce 3 million tires of two dozen sizes, 200,000 agricultural tires and 100,000 linear meters of conveyor belts, allowing meeting the needs of the domestic market by almost 100%.
<br><br>
The turn-key contract for the construction of the plant was signed with the Chinese company Poly Technologies Inc in August 2014. It aimed at using advanced technologies and equipment in order to establish the production of tires in line with high international standards.
<br><br>
The total cost of the project is $213.9 million. The Asaka Bank and Eximbank of China signed a $156.3 million loan agreement to finance the project in July 2015. The remainder of the funds will be allocated by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan, O’zkimyosanoat, O’zavtosanoat, Navoi Mining and Smelting Plant, and Almalyk MSP.
<br><br>
Solution of organizational issues and opening of funding proceeded with construction works. It is worth noting that the project provides for the maximum use of local material and human resources. For example, O’zbekgidroenergokurilish workers were involved in the preparation of pits. Ferganakimyomontaj specialists built almost three kilometers of fence. A railway track is laid by workers of Uzbekistan Railways. The construction site is supplied with electricity and water from two drilled wells. A concrete unit with the capacity of 90 cubic meters of concrete per hour is supplied with cement from Jizzakh Cement Plant. Fitting for the foundation is delivered by Uzmetkombinat. Sand and gravel are brought from nearby quarries.
<br><br>
Concrete works are underway at the construction site. Orders for equipment supplies have already been placed under the processing chain, prior to the completion of construction. The equipment will be delivered in Angren in 2017.
<br><br>
Experts already work on prospects of production development. They include expansion of tire production capacity to 5 million items, as well as the organization of truck tire production. Over time, as part of localization and import substitutiuion, specialists of Uzmetkombinat will help to handle the production of steel cord for tires, and Uzbekneftegaz National Holding Company will help with synthetic rubber, which will allow refusing from imports, increasing the level of localization of domestic rubber products, reducing their cost and increasing export capacity .

The first three pilot manufactures will be created in Jizzakh, Surkhandarya and Tashkent regions on the basis of the selected operating companies that have an appropriate engineering, communication and transport infrastructure, and are equipped with advanced high-tech equipment. The total project cost will exceed $7.3 million.
<br><br>
The biggest manufacture will be established in Urtachirchik district of Tashkent region. It is scheduled to produce up to 30,000 cubic meters of products annually. The Chinese investors intend to invest at least $3.5 million in its development. The two other facilities will have smaller capacities – up to 10,000 cubic meters of chipboard per year. All the facilities are scheduled for launch in late 2017.
<br><br>
The government entrusted Uzstroymaterialy Company with implementation of projects. The company is responsible for the development and approval of the detailed feasibility study of projects, envisaging the use of modern energy-efficient process lines and equipment by December 1 of the current year.
<br><br>
It is planned to concurrently start the working on the system of cotton stalk supply for the production of particle boards, select specific farms and settle a mechanism of clearing payments with producers.

In particular, with regard to the organizations and enterprises with less than 50 people of staff and with a low level of danger in the production process, labor protection measures are performed by professional players of this market on a contract basis.
<br><br>
As part of enhancing the responsibility of employers and employees, separate articles stipulate the rights and duties of employers and employees in the field of occupational safety and health, as well as regulations on the voluntary audit of occupational safety management system, and the procedure of evaluation of workplaces in working conditions and state examination.
<br><br>
 Experts of the Ministry of Labor believe that the new law will raise the responsibility of both employers and employees. It will also contribute to the proper organization of labor protection, ensuring safe working conditions for employees.
<br><br>
It is expected that the act will strengthen the prevention and reduce occupational accidents and diseases, which, in turn, would enhance the economic viability of enterprises, strengthen the social protection of workers, including minors.
<br><br>
“The implementation of the Law ‘On labor protection’ in the new edition envisages the revision of occupational safety and health related regulations, as well as adoption of an integrated programm on streamlining working conditions in enterprises,” emphasized the Ministry of Labor of Uzbekistan.

Generally, this is an example of how the private sector is turning into an assistant for the state in all areas today, including the development of extra-curricular education and promotion of engineering education in particular. The Robokidz Director Timur Azamatov shared the missions of the robotics school with Uzbekistan Today.
<br><br>
The participants for the World Robot Olympiad have been selected. What are the chances of our students?
<br><br>
“Despite we are beginners, we are brainy. The upcoming Olympiad is not our first international competition. In spring, our team ranked sixth among the participants of the Russian Robot Fest from 24 countries.
<br><br>
Regarding the forthcoming Olympiad, we are interested in both results and participation. As you know, Robokidz is the official representative of the World Robot Olympiad, the initiator of the country’s first robotics competitions – the qualifying round of the World Olympiad. We seek to expand international cooperation to make sure that children take interest in learning. The urge for participation in prestigeous competitions will be an excellent motivation.
<br><br>
This year, the republican competition took place in the framework of the ICTWEEK. The beginners were competing on the first and third days with the only goal to win. Those who have already reached a certain level competed for a pass to the World Robot Olympiad, to be held in India. Aiming at participation in the international competition, children do their best to better understand the technologies, learn solving more complicated tasks. For example, in the competition for the World Olympiad, the children needed to ‘teach’ the robot to pass a certain distance on a given route, and sort the blocks by color. This is a fairly difficult task.”
<br><br>
You have founded the country\'s first private school of robotics, which is already very popular. What was the risk of creating such an unusual business project?
<br><br>
“First of all, I would like to note that the number of children who want to learn robotics, is constantly growing. It is obvious that a state that focuses on robotics and information technologies will develop effectively. By watching that, parents are ready to orient their children to engineering education. They realize that this area is a business of the future. Engineering clubs help to involve children in this area, cultivating their interest in it: they begin with introducing a technology of ‘smart home’, alarm and other systems at home. It is fun for them, because they are dealing with a toy that can be made to move and perform certain tasks.

I did not focus on making profit from the school, the more so we address social programs: children from poor families are trained for free. I have been fond of engineering and programming since my childhood. Today, my passion has become the major business of my life: I manage a software development company. The school Robokidz is my contribution to the future of my country.”
<br><br>
The Turin Polytechnic University in Tashkent, Tashkent University of Information Technologies and other universities have been increasingly paying attention to staff training in this area. Is the school activity linked to these institutions?
<br><br>
“No, all the initiatives have been implemented concurrently, without any agreements. However, I know some experts who are engaged in the development of this trend in higher education institutions. Despite the fact that we complement each other and our activities are built into a unified system of training specialists in robotics, we work independently of each other.
<br><br>
Our students are provided with ready construction sets and software by Lego company, but higher education institutions focus on preparing children for independent engineering of robots, and development of software for them.”
<br><br>
Do you work only within your school?
<br><br>
“We seek to build a dialogue with educational institutions, including children\'s creativity centers Barkamol Avlod. We are ready to cooperate with everyone, but so far, we are ‘good friends’ only with private schools Sehriyo, Leader, and are planning to reach out to a private school Erudite. I would like to point out to intensifying cooperation between public institutions and private sector over the recent years. Their representatives take part in various international conferences, realizing that we all are doing the same thing.”
<br><br>
I\'ve heard that soon the Robokidz students will deal with more complicated models ...
<br><br>
“Yes, we have some new projects afoot. In the near future we plan to design radio-controlled quadcopters, and flying drones. By the way, we will make the latter using the 3D-printer. The equipment is already available. The first drone we had created hovered over the hall exhibits at ICTWEEK.
